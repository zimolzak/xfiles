Detailed X-Files Ratings
========================

I want to get the individual data points for each IMDb user's rating
of each episode of the television show "The X-Files." Then I want to
plot each histogram, in a nice way, over time.

How to use these files (so far):

1. Download the list of episode links from
  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106179/eprate?ref_=ttep_ql_3
2. Rename this to ep_ratings.html
3. Run findlinks.pl on it, to generate get_htmls.sh
4. Run get_htmls.sh (takes maybe a minute).
